## Installation

First, add `store_locator` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/using-packages/).

You also need to implement `google_maps_flutter` properly, check their [guide](https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter)

## Import

You can import the package with:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_typeahead/flutter_typeahead.dart';
```

## Example

```dart
StoreLocator<Store>(
  mapConfiguration: const MapConfiguration(
    initialCameraPosition: CameraPosition(
      target: LatLng(45.464211, 9.191383),
      zoom: 10,
    ),
  ),
  positionCallback: (position) async {
    Response response = await Dio().get('stores', queryParameters: {
      "latitude": position.latitude,
      "longitude": position.longitude,
    });
    if (response.statusCode == 200 || response.statusCode == 201) {
      return storesFromJson(response.data);
    }
    return [];
  },
  markerBuilder: (store) {
    return Marker(
      markerId: MarkerId(store.id.toString()),
      position: LatLng(store.latitude, store.longitude),
      infoWindow: InfoWindow(
        title: store.name,
        snippet: store.city,
      ),
    );
  },
)
```

See the `example` directory for a complete sample app.
